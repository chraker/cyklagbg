# cyklagbg
Simple WebApp testing the open data api for bike stations in gothenburg

Hosted at: https://cyklagbg.herokuapp.com/cyklagbg/

Some functionality still missing. The idea was to get directions by picking uo a bike at an optimal location and then dropping it of, optimizing for duration. Did not get that far. However one can get the closest bike by either allowing geoloc or enter address manually.

Currently a maximum of 10 stations is checked, to spare my google api quota. Will enable matrix search later to improve it.
